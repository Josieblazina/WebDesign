# 2001 a Space Odyssey
## Directed by Stanley Kubrick
2001 is one of my favorite pieces of media of all time for its groundbreaking cinematography and themes while being a film made in the 1960s. It's a stable in the category of science fiction and explores themes of AI which are only becoming more prevelent in present time. It's very visually appealing and pushes traditional boundaries of what films can do.
