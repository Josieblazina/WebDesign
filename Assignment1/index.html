<h1>Little Women</h1>

<h2>By Louisa May Alcott</h2>

<p>I love "Little Women" because it captures the beauty of sisterhood, ambition, and growing up with such warmth and authenticity. The story doesn't shy away from the sacrifices ambition requires or the fear of failure that comes with chasing your dreams, but it also celebrates the courage it takes to believe your work and your voice matter. Below are some quotes and commentary that I love.</p>


<h3>Quote 1</h3>

<p>“No no its no use Jo, Jo we gotta have it out I have loved you ever since I’ve known you Jo I couldn’t help it, and and I tried to show you and you wouldn’t let me and I must make you here now and give me an answer because I cannot go on like this any longer, I gave up billiards I gave up everything you didn’t like I’m happy I did it’s fine and I waited and I never complained because I you know I figured you’d love me jo and I realised im not half good enough and im not this great man and”
    ― Louisa May Alcott, Little Women </p>

    <p>I love this quote because it This quote captures one of the most heartbreaking moments in literature, when Laurie finally accepts that Jo doesn't love him romantically, no matter how much he wishes she did. It's achingly honest about unrequited love and the painful wisdom of knowing when to let go of someone you care about.</p>

<h3>Quote 2</h3>

<p>“…because talent isn't genius, and no amount of energy can make it so. I want to be great, or nothing.”
    ― Louisa May Alcott, Little Women </p>

   <p> I love this quote because it tackles the concept of ambition versus perfectionism and I feel like most independent personalities can relate to this quote.</p>

<h3>Quote 3</h3>

<p>"I'm so sick of people saying that love is all a woman is fit for,"
    - Louisa May Alcott, Little Women </p>
    
    <p>I love this quote because it puts my mindset as a woman more toward bettering myself and less toward loving someone else. It focuses on loving one's self and ambition first before seeking that validation from others. </p>
