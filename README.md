this is my root repository for this class and inside are my assignment folders
Assignment 2: I am doing well! This module went fairly well for me with a few minor hiccups but I was able to get a lot figured out with some trial and error!

I don't need anything too specific from you for this class currently, due dates can be a little challenging for me to meet so i appreciate you still accepting work that is late! Thank you!
