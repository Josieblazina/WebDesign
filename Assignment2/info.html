<h1>More Information</h1>

<p>Little Women has been adapted so many times because the themes are timeless. Whether it's the 1994 version or the 2019 Greta Gerwig film, each adaptation brings something new while staying true to what makes the story special. What I love most is how the book challenges traditional expectations for women and celebrates ambition, creativity, and independence. It's a reminder that you don't have to choose between loving others and loving yourself.</p>
