<h1>About Little Women</h1>

<p>I first read Little Women when I was younger, and it's stuck with me ever since. There's something about the way Alcott writes about the March sisters that feels so real and honest. The book doesn't sugarcoat the struggles of growing up or the complicated feelings that come with wanting more out of life. It's a story about family, yes, but it's also about finding yourself and figuring out what you're willing to sacrifice for your dreams.</p>
